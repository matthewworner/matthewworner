## About

Led international iPhone, iPod, and iTunes rollouts at Apple across 20+ markets, delivered agency campaigns for major NZ brands, and founded **DWSPBuilder** — a compliance SaaS platform now helping schools, councils, and water suppliers in Australia and New Zealand navigate Drinking Water Safety Plans with less pain and more precision.

After years of high-stakes delivery, I rediscovered the pure joy of building: coming up with ideas, then using today's powerful AI tools (LLMs, on-device ML, rapid prototyping) to turn them into working products fast.

Engineering apprenticeship roots + self-taught digital path + proven ability to thrive under pressure. Strong on user needs, Agile execution, regulatory navigation, cross-functional leadership, and using AI to accelerate sustainable creation — from spark to shipped.

**Core Strengths**  
→ Practical delivery & backlog prioritization  
→ Stakeholder alignment & cross-functional leadership  
→ UX-driven design & rapid prototyping  
→ Regulatory/tech complexity navigation  
→ AI-enabled acceleration & sustainable bootstrapping

**Professional Experience** (highlights)  
- **2023–Present**: Product Owner & Founder, **DWSPBuilder** (Australia & NZ) — Bootstrapped SaaS for compliance workflows, user-validated with schools/councils, AI-accelerated prototyping.  
- **2019–Present**: Senior Digital Delivery Lead & Product Owner (Contract) — Remote custom web/dev for education & small biz.  
- **2005–2011**: Project Manager, **Apple Inc.** (London/Paris/Cupertino) — Led multi-region launches for iPhone/iPod/iTunes across 56 sites in 23 languages.  
- Earlier: Saatchi & Saatchi, World Vision, GEMS Education, Aparlay, Sun Microsystems, etc.

**Skills & Expertise**
